CITATIONS:

I received help from the following sources, as I needed help with creating an array of linked lists to store the adjacency list. I didn't know how to write the syntax for it so I looked online for help.
Additionally, I needed help with iterating through the values in the adjacency list as well, so I used this source to help me:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus-program-to-implement-adjacency-list

I also used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/ to help me keep track of the vertices I've already seen (keeping a seen/visited list). I also noticed that the format of the BFS in the link was very similar to this week's pseudocode for the BFS which I followed as well.
